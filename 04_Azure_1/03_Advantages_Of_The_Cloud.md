### Resultaat

1. **Geo-distrubution** - You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
2. **Agility** - Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.
3. **Scalability** - Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:
   - Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
   - Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
4. **High availability** - Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
5. **Elasticity** - You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need. It can decrease resource if they are underused or increase if demand is high.
6. **Disaster recovery** - By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.


**Consumption-based Model** - End users only pay for the resources that the use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.
A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
- No Upfront costs
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
- the ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
- the ability to stop paying for resources taht are no longer needed.
