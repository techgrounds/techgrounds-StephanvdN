### Pilars Well-Architected Framework


**Reliability** - Meet commitments you make to users and customers. Enable applications to recover from failures at any scale, by architecting reliability into your application framework. In traditional app development, reliability meant purchasing layers of redundant, high-end hardware to prevent app failure completely. Because failure inevitably happens, Azure seeks to minimize the impact of a single component failing. When you build for reliability in the cloud, you ensure a highly available architecture as well as recovery from failures such as data loss, major downtime, or ransomware incidents.

**Cost optimization** - Get the most value from your cloud investment. Cost optimization for well-architected workloads means reducing unnecessary expenses and improving operational efficiencies. Create economically efficient workloads by balancing business goals with budget justifications. Manage your Azure spending with the tools, offers, and guidance to help you optimize workload costs, save money, and understand and forecast your bill.

**Operation Excellence** - Keep apps running as expected. In the Well-Architected Framework, operational excellence covers the operations processes that keep applications running in production. Deployments must be reliable and predictable. All systems must be observable because in a large application, logging into virtual machines to troubleshoot an issue or sift through log files is impractical and sometimes impossible. Monitoring and diagnostics give insight into the system, so that you know when and where failures occur.

**Performance efficiency** - Scale to meet demands dynamically. To achieve performance efficiency for well-architected workloads, you need to be able to anticipate load increases for your cloud environment to meet business requirements. Contrary to on-premises environments, though, you may no longer need to make long-term predictions for expected changes to ensure capacity. Take both performance requirements and budget into consideration through well-architected principles as you scale up or out with Azure solutions.

**Security** - Strengthen your posture.
Well-architected workloads rest on a foundation of highly secure services and practices. Security is a fundamental pillar that enables organizations to operate, innovate and scale. As one of the most important aspects of any architecture, security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against attacks and abuse of data and systems. Protect workloads with the multilayered security of Azure—across physical datacenters, infrastructure, and operations—and stay ahead of evolving threats using AI. Plus, enlist a team of +8,500 global Microsoft cybersecurity experts to help safeguard your assets and data in Azure, allowing your SecOps teams to spend time focusing on what matters most to your business.
